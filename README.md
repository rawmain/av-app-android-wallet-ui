## About

The Age Verification (AV) android app is part of the Age Verification Solution Toolbox and serves as a component that can be used by Member States, if necessary, to develop a national solution and build upon the building blocks of the toolbox.

This android app is forked from [EUDI Android Wallet reference application](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui), which is built based on the [Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md) and aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication, and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

The Age Verification (AV) Android Implementation is based on a modular architecture composed of business-agnostic, reusable components that will evolve in incremental steps and can be re-used across multiple projects.

The AV Android is the application that allows users to:

1. Obtain, store, and present an age verification attestation.
2. Share the proof of age attestation with online services to gain access.

## Development

### Prerequisites

**Installation:**

### Specifications Employed

The app consumes the SDK called EUDIW Wallet core [Wallet core](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-lib-android-wallet-core) and a list of available libraries to facilitate remote presentation and issuing test/demo functionality following partially the specification of the [ARF](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework), including:

- OpenID4VP - v1 (remote presentation), DCQL

- OpenID4VCI v1 (issuing)
  
### Build

Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described [here](./docs/how_to_build.md) and the configuration options are described [here](./docs/configuration.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum device requirement for this application is  Android API level 29.

### Testing

To test the app, there is an issuer and verifier service available online. This allows you to perform the enrollment directly from within the app or via the online issuer in order to receive a proof of age attestation. With the verifier, you can then present this attestation.

- **Issuer functionality**, to support development and testing, one can access an OID4VCI test/demo service for issuing at: [Age Verification Issuer](https://issuer.ageverification.dev/)
 
- **Relying Party functionality:** To support development and testing, one can access a test/demo service for remote presentation at: [Age Verification Verifier](https://verifier.ageverification.dev/)

### How to release the app

To publish the app on the Google Play Store, several steps must be completed. A detailed description can be found [here](./docs/release_guide.md):

* **Create a Developer Account:** Register for a Google Play Developer account using your Google account. You will need to accept the developer distribution agreement and pay a one-time registration fee. If your app will offer in-app purchases or paid content, you must also set up a Google Payments merchant account.

* **Create a New Application:**  In the Google Play Console, select "All Apps" and click "Create App." Enter the app name and choose the default language and app type (app or game).

* **Complete the Store Listing:** Fill out all required information for your app’s store entry, including the app description, screenshots, icon, category, and contact details. The more information you provide, the better your app will be found in search results.

* **Upload the App Bundle (AAB) or APK:** Upload your app’s Android App Bundle (AAB) or APK file. Since August 2021, new apps must be published using the AAB format.

* **Content Rating:** Complete the content rating questionnaire to ensure your app is properly classified. Without this, your app may be removed from the Play Store.

* **Set Pricing and Distribution:** Decide whether your app will be free or paid, and select the countries in which it will be available. Note that you can change a paid app to free, but not vice versa.

* **Review and Launch:** Double-check all information and settings. Once everything is complete and all sections are marked as finished, confirm the release to submit your app for review. Google will review your submission, which can take several hours to a couple of days. After approval, your app will be published on the Play Store

## Important note

This white-label application is a reference implementation of the Age Verification solution that should be customised before publishing it. The current version is not feature complete and will require further integration work before production deployment. In particular, any national-specific enrolment procedures must be implemented by the respective Member States or publishing parties.

To enhance security, it is strongly recommended that the allowed PINs raise the overall security level. Sequential or easily guessable patterns (such as "135246 or "147258") should not be permitted. Additionally, it is advisable to check against a list of the most commonly used or "pwned" PINs to prevent users from choosing weak credentials.

Please note that this application is still under active development. It is regularly updated and new features and improvements are continuously being added.
